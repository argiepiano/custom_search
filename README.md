# Custom Search

This module provides new custom search blocks. If you need to have
options available like in advanced search, but directly in the search block,
this module is for you.

## Backdrop port status

This is a port of my Custom Search module for Drupal 7.

Config system conversion and upgrade path have been done.

Custom Search Blocks submodule is not needed anymore, because the new
Layout module allows multiple blocks from the same module.

Custom Search Taxonomy and Internationalization have been merged
into the main module.

## Basic options

The module adds options to select:

-   which content type(s) to search,

-   which taxonomy term(s) to search,

-   which specific module search to use (node, help, user or any module that
    implements search),

-   advanced criteria

For all these choices, there are options to switch between a select box,
checkboxes or radio buttons, and also customize the selector label and the
default - Any - text.

## Advanced options

There are also options to:

change the default search box label, add a default text in the search box, add
advanced search criteria, change the default submit button text, use an image
instead of the submit button, change the order of all the elements, include some
elements in a popup block, add a filter to the results page, show/hide basic
and/or advanced search in the results page, show/hide meta data in the results
page, multiple search pathsâ€¦

## Included submodules

-   Custom Search Taxonomy: taxonomy options for the search block

-   Custom Search Internationalization: search content from all or current
    language only, and all label and selectors translation handling
