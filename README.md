Custom Search
=============

This module alters the default search box in many ways. If you need to have
options available like in advanced search, but directly in the search box, this
module is for you.

Basic options
-------------

The module adds options to select:

-   which content type(s) to search,

-   which specific module search to use (node, help, user or any module that
    implements search),

-   which input type to use (with Elements),

-   advanced criteria

For all these choices, there are options to switch between a select box,
checkboxes or radio buttons, and also customize the selector label and the
default - Any - text.

Advanced options
----------------

There are also options to:

change the default search box label, add a default text in the search box, add
advanced search criteria, change the default submit button text, use an image
instead of the submit button, change the order of all the elements, include some
elements in a popup block, add a filter to the results page, show/hide basic
and/or advanced search in the results page, show/hide meta data in the results
page, multiple search paths
